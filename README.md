# DatabaseRepository

Welcome to the DatabaseRepository gem!
This gem was written to provide an extra layer to Rails applications called repositories.
Repositories are used to 'speak' with our database and execute all queries.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'database_repository'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install database_repository

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
